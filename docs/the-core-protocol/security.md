# Security

### Has deBridge been audited?

Yes, deBridge smart contracts have been audited by Halborn, Zokyo and Ackee Blockchain.

Security will always be deBridge's main priority and it’s vital to have a reliable and secure protocol from day one. It’s one of the main components that will determine the future progression of cross-chain interoperability. That’s why the deBridge team will have that as one of the main focus areas both before and after the protocol launch.&#x20;

### Third-party security audits

All the reports are stored in the deBridge GitHub repository:
