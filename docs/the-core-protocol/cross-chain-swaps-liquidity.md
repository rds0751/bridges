# Cross-Chain Swaps Liquidity

## **Provision of liquidity for cross-chain pools at Curve**

deBridge is a decentralized infrastructure that is fully composable with the existing DeFi ecosystem. That‚Äôs why we don‚Äôt need to do our own AMM or DEX, but just create different liquidity pools for deAssets in existing DEXes. In every blockchain supported by deBridge, there will be a liquidity pool for deUSDC at Curve or protocols that support the concept of the stable swap.

Cross-chain swaps is one of the applications built on top of deBridge infrastructure that enables users to perform swaps from any asset on one chain to any asset on another.

Here are the instructions on how to deposit liquidity into the pool for each blockchain/L2.

### **Arbitrum deUSDC/2CRV pool**

This is a stablecoin pool at Curve that contains deUSDC (USDC bridged through deBridge) paired with 2CRV - Curve token that represents the basket of two stable coins (USDT+USDC)

In case you want to deposit $X amount of liquidity into this pool, please bridge half ($X/2) amount of USDC from Ethereum to deUSDC in Arbitrum through deBridge at [https://app.debridge.finance/](https://app.debridge.finance). The other half should be bridged through Arbitrum‚Äôs default bridge [https://bridge.arbitrum.io/](https://bridge.arbitrum.io) in the form of USDT or USDC.

_Be aware that you will need to have some ETH on your wallet in Arbitrum in order to cover gas costs to broadcast the transaction._

Once you have deUSDC and USDC/USDT in your wallet balance on Arbitrum (you can check through [https://arbiscan.io/](https://arbiscan.io)), you can deposit the liquidity at Curve.

1. Go to the Curve website of the pool: [https://arbitrum.curve.fi/factory/17/deposit](https://arbitrum.curve.fi/factory/17/deposit)&#x20;
